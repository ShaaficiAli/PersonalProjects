This is a program that analysizes the closing prices for a google stock
in between 2017/03/23 to 2018/03/23 and draws a line of best fit using
gradient descent. I calculated the derivative of an error measurement
and used that as a signal of which direction the line should update itself in.
No machine learning libraries were used in this, I wanted to learn the math behind
gradient descent and code it from scratch. If you want a better explaination feel free
to email me.
