This is a program I wrote in which I created a state vector machine to create model that generated a 
boundary line inbetween to groups of points. This is a case of supervised machine learning. Using hinge loss
my model optimized a weight vector so that errors would be at a minumum and with each iteration it got closer to 0.
A diagram is in the file decision_boundary.png.No machine learning libraries were used in this, 
I wanted to learn the math behind behind code it from scratch. Kernels were not used in the model
and the function does not not linearly seperable groups.
