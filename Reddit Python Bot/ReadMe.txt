A reddit bot that goes on a page in Reddit.com called TIL. this stands for today I learned. Using reddits python api this bot collects
the titles of posts in the page and stores it in the bottil text document. The program can sort the information using functions I have written
that sortts the text based off of different metrics. For example on method sorts it by length while another sorts it lexigraphically.
A master sort function prompts and asks the user which sort they would like to do.
