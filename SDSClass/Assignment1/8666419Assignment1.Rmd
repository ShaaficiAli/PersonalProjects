```{r}
shaf <- read.csv("data_set_1.csv")
categories <-table(shaf$dow)
barplot(categories)
```
By the data, races are only on Monday and Friday.

```{r}
m <- mean(shaf$seconds)
s <- sd(shaf$seconds)
```
The mean is `r m` and the standard deviation is `r s`

5)
```{r}
aggdata <- aggregate(shaf[1],list(shaf$dow), FUN = function(x) c(mn = mean(x), n = sd(x)) )
plot(aggdata)
X <- split(shaf,shaf$dow)
Friday <- X[[1]]
Monday <- X[[2]]
